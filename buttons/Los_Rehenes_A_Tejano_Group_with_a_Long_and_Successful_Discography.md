Los Rehenes were formed by Javier Torres, who is the lead singer and songwriter of the group. He was inspired by his father, who was also a musician and taught him how to play the guitar and the accordion. Javier Torres started composing songs when he was 15 years old and formed his first band with his brothers and cousins. They called themselves Los Rehenes, which means "the hostages", because they felt they were captives of their passion for music.
 
The group recorded their first album, "Lloro, LlorÃ©", in 1989 with the label DMY. The album was a success and launched them to fame in their hometown of Zacatecas. They soon signed with Fonovisa, one of the biggest labels in the Tejano market, and released several albums that consolidated their popularity in Mexico and the United States. Some of their most famous songs from this period are "El Amor No Se Esconde", "Cuando Era un Jovencito", "Corazones Rotos", "Porque Estas Enamorada", and "Cuando un Hombre".
 
In 1992, Los Rehenes switched to Disa, another major label in the Tejano scene, and released their album "Los Rehenes 92 En Lo Grande". This album marked a turning point in their career, as they achieved mainstream success and recognition. They also experimented with different musical styles, such as cumbia, ballad, and duranguense. Some of their most successful songs from this era are "Verdades Que Duelen", "Ni el Ultimo Ni el Primero", "Canciones de Amor", "Todo Me Recuerda a Ti", "Dejame Sonar Contigo", and "PregÃºntame a Mi".
