In this article, we will show you how to use Fatxplorer v2.0 36 to manage your Xbox 360 data. This version only supports Xbox 360 devices. If you have an original Xbox device, you can try the beta version 3.0[^1^].
 
## Download and Install Fatxplorer v2.0 36
 
The first step is to download and install Fatxplorer v2.0 36 on your Windows PC. You can download the 64-bit or 32-bit version from the official website[^1^]. There is a 7-day trial period where you can evaluate Fatxplorer to ensure it meets your needs. If you need more time, you can request an extension.
 
After downloading the setup file, run it and follow the instructions to install Fatxplorer on your PC. You may need to restart your PC after the installation.
 
## Connect Your Xbox 360 Device to Your PC
 
The next step is to connect your Xbox 360 device to your PC using a compatible cable or adapter. For example, you can use a SATA to USB cable for hard drives, or a memory unit driver for memory units[^1^]. You can also use an offline hard drive cloner to clone your data from one device to another.
 
Once you connect your device, launch Fatxplorer and wait for it to detect your device. You may see a loading bar that shows the progress of scanning your device. This may take longer for devices that have been cloned using an offline cloner[^1^].
 
## Select Your Device Partition and Mount It to Windows
 
After Fatxplorer detects your device, you will see a list of partitions on your device. You can select the partition you want to access and click on "Mount" to mount it to Windows as a virtual drive. This will allow you to browse and modify your data using Windows Explorer or any other program.
 
You can also right-click on any partition and choose from various options such as format, clone, restore, transfer, etc. For example, you can format your device to FATX (the Xbox 360 file system), clone your data from one device to another, restore your data from a backup file, transfer your data between devices or PC folders, etc.
 
## Manage Your Xbox 360 Data Using Fatxplorer or Windows Explorer
 
Once you mount your device partition to Windows, you can manage your Xbox 360 data using Fatxplorer or Windows Explorer. You can view, edit, copy, paste, delete, rename, move, or create files and folders on your device as if it were a normal drive.
 
You can also use Fatxplorer's advanced features such as file permissions editor, file recovery tool, file splitter/joiner tool, file hasher tool, etc. You can access these features by right-clicking on any file or folder and choosing "Fatxplorer".
 
## Unmount Your Device Partition and Safely Remove Your Device
 
When you are done managing your Xbox 360 data, you should unmount your device partition from Windows and safely remove your device from your PC. To do this, go back to Fatxplorer and click on "Unmount" for the partition you mounted earlier. Then click on "Safely Remove" for your device.
 
This will ensure that all the changes you made are saved properly and that there is no risk of data corruption or loss. You can then disconnect your device from your PC and use it on your Xbox 360 console.
